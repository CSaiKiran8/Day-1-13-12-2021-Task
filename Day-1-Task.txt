2Q)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Answer:-

HTTP1.1 ->

1)It supports connection reuse i.e. for every TCP connection there could be multiple requests and responses, and 
  pipelining where the client can request several resources from the server at once. However, pipelining was hard 
  to implement due to issues such as head-of-line blocking and was not a feasible solution.
2)Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of a message. 
  Can define 24 status codes, error reporting is quicker and more efficient.
3)It is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication
4)Expands on the caching support by using additional headers like cache-control, conditional headers 
  like If-Match and by using entity tags.
5)HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0. However, 
  TCP starts slowly and with domain sharding (resources can be downloaded simultaneously by using multiple domains), 
  connection reuse and pipelining, there is an increased risk of network congestion

HTTP2 ->

1)Uses multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection resources to be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client 
  almost at the same time. It is done using streams which can be prioritized, can have dependencies and individual 
  flow control. It also provides a feature called server push that allows the server to send data that the client will 
  need but has not yet requested
2)Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers, status codes remains the same
3)Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However, it is better equipped to 
  deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security
4)HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching. With the server push feature if the client finds the resources 
  are already present in the cache, it can cancel the pushed stream.
5)HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin along 
  with being less sensitive to network delays.

3Q)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Answer:-

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

The following code assigns many values (Mercedes, C-class, White and soo on) to a variable named Car:

var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”,
	  Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”,
	  Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

Syntax: 
var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};

So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.


Object Properties :-
The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.

The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.
Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

The syntax to access a property from an object is:
objectName.property        // Car.Make
           //or
objectName["property”]    // Car["Make"]
          //or
objectName[expression]   // x = "Make"; Car[x]


Object Methods :-
An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

i.e.,

Let’s assume to start the car there will be a mechanical functionality.

function(){return ignition.on}
and so similar is to stop/brake/headlights on & off, etc.
So, Conclusion and simple definition for Java Script Object methods is 
“Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.”.
